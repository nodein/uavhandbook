  abstract = {A particular postsynthesis problem is examined. Assume a first complex
	controller running on a given system. It turns out that a closed-loop
	mode is not sufficiently damped. Is it easy to know which adjustable
	combinations of controller parameters are the most relevant to master
	this problem? A Bayesian identification procedure is proposed to
	analyze the relevance of such a given parameter combination with
	respect to a given modal specification. One application, for which
	such a controller tuning is very interesting, is the adjustment of
	flight control laws during flight tests. In this practical context,
	the observer-based realization of the controller is used to derive
	an architecture suitable for its implementation, that is, an architecture
	in which physical tuning parameters can be easily highlighted. The
	results presented concern the lateral flight control law of a highly
	flexible aircraft that has been synthesized by a modern robust control
	approach.},

	law philosophy and an associated system architecture applicable to
	transport aircraft are defined. The extensive use of ground-based
	simulators, complemented by flight tests, was integrated into the
	development process, and the certification procedure was adapted
	to take the benefits of fly-by-wire into account. In the A330/A340
	program, all these principles were reproduced. New functions were
	integrated and, in particular, a first step in the direction of structural
	mode control through fly-by-wire was made. Upstream validation tools
	were developed both in the control law and system areas. This method
	contributed to defining a mature system very early in the program's
	development.},

	which is in fact a mixing of optimal control and eigenstructure assignment
	by means of constrained optimization. This technique is used to stabilize
	both rigid and elastic modes in an initial step, and to increase

	to design a robust flight control system. The methodology described
	in this paper has multiple applications. Two different applications
	are considered: the first consists of computing a robust feedback
	with respect to parameter uncertainties by considering a bank of
	models, while the second provides a robust flight-control design
	for a highly flexible aircraft with significant cross-coupling between
	flight mechanics and structural dynamics modes. Theproposed method
	will solve these problems via an iterative optimization under linear
	inequality constraints. Finally, the iterative algorithm is applied
	to a civil aircraft control system in lateral flight.},

	for linear multivariable feedback systems. LQG/LTR is interpreted
	as the solution of a specific weighted H2-tradeoff between transfer
	functions in the frequency domain. Properties of this solution are
	examined for both minimum-phase and nonminimum-phase systems. This
	leads to a formal weight augmentation procedure for the minimum-phase
	case which permits essentially arbitrary specification of system
	sensitivity functions in terms of the weights. While such arbitrary
	specifications are not possible for nonminimum-phase problems, a
	direct relationship between weights and sensitivities is developed
	for nonminimum-phase SISO and certain nonminimum-phase MIMO cases
	which guides the weight selection process.},
